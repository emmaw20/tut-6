# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will refactor the code into separate scripts corresponding to each section. The dataset we will use comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains measurements of penguins from three species.

## Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
library(readr)
penguins <- read_csv("data/penguins.csv")
head(penguins)
```


# Methods

In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare the data for modeling.

## Summary statistics 
```{r}
library(readr)
sum_stats <- read_csv("results/tables/summary_stats.csv")
head(sum_stats)
```


## Summary plot
![Bill Length by species](results/figures/boxplot.png){#box-plot}


# Model

We will fit a classification model using `tidymodels` to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.


```{r}
train <- read_csv("data/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("data/test.csv")
head(train)
head(test)
```


# Results

We evaluate the performance of the model using the test dataset.

```{r}
preds <- read_csv("results/tables/predictions.csv")
conf <- read_csv("results/tables/confusion_matrix.csv")
head(preds)
head(conf)
```

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we:

- Loaded and cleaned the `palmerpenguins` dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Built a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model using `tidymodels`.
- Evaluated the model's performance.
